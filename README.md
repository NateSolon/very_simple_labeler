# very_simple_labeler

This is a widget for labeling data in a Jupyter notebook. It shows you your images one by one and allows you to label them with a simple interface. When you are done, it sorts the images into folders based on the labels you've chosen. For more details on usage, or to try it out, check out the Example notebook in the repository.
